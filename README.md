- Reds correspond with operators, built-ins and keyword operators.
- Orange with functions and function-calls.
- Yellows/Gold for constants and built-in constants like `this`, `false`.
- Yellow/Greens for entities, classes.
- Blues for integers, regexp, strings and keys.
- Gray/Purple for comments
- Gray for braces, parens, semicolons, commas and storage keywords like `let`, `async`
- Whites for everything else, such as general variables.

Language Focus:
- Javascript with `language-babel`
- JSON, Yaml
- PHP, Rust
- JSX, HTML, XML
- CSS, Less, Sass, Stylus
- Markdown


### Be aware
Most language grammars aren't as rich as `language-babel`, thus many elements cannot be targeted.
This is what allows for syntax themes like this.
